The Effect of Phase Noise on Radar Waveforms and Performance Analysis
=====================================================================

Abstract
This paper presents a detailed analysis of the impact of phase noise on commonly used radar waveforms. 
In order to enhance range resolution and increase detection probability in pulsed radar systems, 
the effects of phase noise originating from oscillators on both the transmitter and receiver sides are 
modeled through simulations developed in the MATLAB environment. The study focuses on the generation of 
linear and nonlinear frequency modulated pulses and investigates how incremental increases in 
oscillator-induced phase noise affect these waveforms. The impact of phase noise is examined through 
the outputs of the matched filter at the radar receiver, with frequency spectrums and matched filter 
responses analyzed. Additionally, key performance metrics, such as the Peak-to-Average Noise Ratio (PANR), 
are extracted to assess system performance degradation due to phase noise. The findings provide valuable 
insights into understanding the influence of phase noise in radar systems and its implications for 
waveform selection and system design.
